1. We use <article></article> because its a small independent part that can be part of the bigger website/project.
2.Centering our product card - as CSS file says for this project we can use 
body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
and if it does not work we need to add min-height: 100vh;.
3. We add spacing around (mobile) with margin: 1rem;
4. We set grid property on our .product__content container (the one with all the info about the product) so our button can take 100% of its parent container width.
+ as now its grid we can use gap property to add space between our text, insted of using margin-bottom.
5. <s></s>  --- strike out зачеркнуть BUT look below
6. <s></s> will not be read by PC so for blind people its bed the we need
<span>Current price</span>
<span>Original price</span>
+ CSS
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

7. inline-flex - almost the same as flex, and we need it this time because we have icon inside (and we will need to center all).
8. So now we gonna make make the design for bigger screens. And first thing we need to decide where its gonna break.
And before @media we can set display:grid on our .product class so we then can use it in our media query, and its not gonna inpackt on our current design.
Then in our media query we set 
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .product {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
Move to the picture. At the moment we have two images one in <picture></picture> and the other in <img>.
To switch between two images we can use this trick: media="(min-width: 600px)"
<picture class="product__img">
      <source srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 600px)">
      <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="product display">
    </picture>

Now the only problem we need to solve - the size of the our product card because as we get our screen bigger the card gets too big.
So on our .product we set max-width: 600px
